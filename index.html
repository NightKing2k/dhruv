					<h2>Small Description-</h2>
					<p class="p">
					I am a Mumbaikar who is currently pursuing his Btech in Computer Science from Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida. Yes, many people haven't heard of my university, but this place is really good. They focus on academics and practicals so much that nobody has less than 90% attendance. I along with many others have got a scholarship from the Shiv Nadar Foundation (75% fee faiver) as I faired very well in my 1st year (7.8 CGPA). I love to watch shows and movies in my past time and also go to the gym to stay fit in this unhealthy life. I feel that education is going on it's own adventure in India and my goal is to build a startup which emphasizes more on increasing a student's imagination rather than knowledge.
